# CBAid

CBAid is an application designed to support the practice of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Featuring a user interface with three columns representing different modes, it allows users to experience a simulated dialogical chair work. By sequentially switching between each mode and writing down their thoughts, users can gain awareness of their cognitive distortions from different perspectives.
